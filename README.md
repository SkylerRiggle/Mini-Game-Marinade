**<h2>Git Standards:</h2>**
*As a reminder to all those contributing to this project, it would be advantageous to follow these listed standards while working on this project:*

<br/>

***<li> NEVER push straight to the main branch </li>***

***<li> To update the main branch, please be sure to create a pull request with either Parker or Skyler added as a reviewer. This will ensure that we have a minumum number of conflicts. </li>***

***<li> For each new feature added, I would recommend using a new feature branch starting from the main branch. This will keep the repository organized, and also give us nicer fallback points in the event that something bad happens. </li>***

<br/>

*Beyond that, use whatever standards work best for you (branch names, commit messages, etc.). Just makes sure to be curtious to yourself and others.*
